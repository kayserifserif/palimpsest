# palimpsest
Displays a palimpsestâ€”a generated specimen of the 'average' shapes of numbers and letters, using all fonts on the system, overlaid at 20% opacity.

## Examples
Some images! These were generated using almost 3500 fonts, excluding more unusual fonts.

## Ideas
* Analyse percentage of overlap for each character to determine the most and least 'average' characters
* Design an 'average' font based on the palimpsest
* Generate palimpsests using fonts created by year to identify any progression in type trends over time
